# Rails Engine

Rails Engine is a project using Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API. The API is used to expose the SalesEngine data schema.

This project was assigned week 1 of Module 3  at Turing. The stated **learning goals** are as follows:

- Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
- Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
- Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.

The original project spec can be found [here](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine).
